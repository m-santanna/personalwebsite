# PersonalWebsite

### Description

The idea behind this project is to be able to share critical information about my programming journey to future recruiters and expand my knowledge on different frameworks and common practices.

#### Languages, Frameworks and Libraries

To achieve a solid foundation on React, and to get used to popular CSS frameworks, this project is built with Next.js 13, TailwindCSS and TypeScript. Even though it was asked to build the backend of the website with Django, I came to the conclusion that the goal of this project did not require any API/Models, which made me less susceptible to use Django, since it would restrain me more than generate goods.

#### Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project required me to develop strong intimacy with TailwindCSS, TypeScript and Next.js 13. Which are all high level frameworks/languages that helped me develop my abilities and knowledge of web development. TailwindCSS allowed me to create a highly customizable and responsive UI, abstracting the CSS itself. TypeScript helps with fundamental problems that used to occur when using JavaScript, which at the end of the day is converted back to JS. Next.js was more than enough to build a fullstack app that has different routes, and runs multiple components.

### Sections

#### Navbar

The NavBar contains links for all the sections that are present on the website, that were created by the Link component, made by the Next.js team, that doesn't render all the data from the page again. Differently than the anchor tag. The NavBar also has a button to switch between the light and the dark theme. Feature done with the next-theme library.

#### HomeSection

The home section has an introduction to the website while also demonstrating a minimalistic design. It required a few nested components, and knowledge of the flex property of css. Property that is needed in the majority of the project.

#### AboutSection

This section contains all my information needed to know my strengths and weaknesses to get a better grasp of my knowledge and experience on Computer Science.

#### ProjectsSection

This section is responsible to showcase all the projects done while taking CS50Web and a few personal projects that I idealized and started developing. Each project has a link attached to its name, opening a new tab of the users browser, and showcasing the GitHub repository with the project's content.

#### ContactSection

This section contains links to my GitHub, Linkedin and Email accounts, allowing any visitors to contact me.
