# Thoughts

This project was one of the first projects I built when I got started with React, Next.js and Tailwind 2 years ago.
Since then, my skills have naturally grown, so has my desire to build something better than what I had before.
This is the result I landed. Had some bumpy roads, had to learn some stuff, get some components here and there, 
but the result ended up being pretty clean, if I may say so myself.
